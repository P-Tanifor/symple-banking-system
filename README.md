# simple-banking-system
simple project that mimics credit card operations in banking

Description

We live busy lives these days. Between work, chores, and other things in our to-do lists, it can be tough to catch your breath and stay calm. Credit cards are one of the things that save us time, energy, and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with a database.

If youâ€™re curious about business, technology, or how things around you work, you'll probably enjoy learning how credit card numbers work. These numbers ensure easy payments, and they also help prevent payment errors and fraud. Card numbers are evolving, and they might look different in the near future.

Let's take a look at the anatomy of a credit card:



The very first number is the Major Industry Identifier (MII), which tells you what sort of institution issued the card.

1 and 2 are issued by airlines
3 is issued by travel and entertainment
4 and 5 are issued by banking and financial institutions
6 is issued by merchandising and banking
7 is issued by petroleum companies
8 is issued by telecommunications companies
9 is issued by national assignment
In our banking system, credit cards should begin with 4.
